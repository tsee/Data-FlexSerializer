Revision history for Perl extension Data::FlexSerializer

1.10 Thu May 30 09:17:55 UTC 2013

 - Changed the API so that you can't change input/output formats on
   runtime. Supporting this was always a pain in the ass (and largely
   broken in 1.09).

   Now if you want two different kinds of options you need to make two
   serializers, not munge an existing one.

1.09 Wed Feb  13 15:00:00 UTC 2013

 - Adding support for custom serialization formats

1.08 Mon Nov  5 13:35:50 UTC 2012

 - Dynamically changing the output_format without a custom
   serial_encoder didn't work if the output format was set to
   'sereal'.

   Now we'll dynamically construct a Sereal::Encoder object if needed
   if the output format changes from e.g. Storable to Sereal.

 - Change the POD tagline to include Sereal.

1.07 Fri Nov  2 14:59:07 CET 2012

 - Add support for the Sereal format. This adds a dependency on
   Sereal::{Decoder,Encoder}.

 - Remove redundant check of the close() exit code under the autodie
   pragma.

1.06  Tue Jun 12 19:00 2012
  - detect_storable docs

1.05  Wed May 09 17:00 2012
  - Add tests for file/fh (de)serialization

  - Allow (de)serializing from file handles

  - Check status when closing $fh on file (de)serialization

1.04  Tue Feb 21 07:30 2012
  - Explicit dependency on autodie.

  - Mark POD as utf8 for consumers' benefit.

1.03  Fri Feb 17 07:45 2012
  - Load File::Spec explicitly in tests.

1.02  Wed Feb 15 14:00 2012
  - Require new-enough Test::More.

  - More tests.

1.01
  - We now only use Moose instead of using Any::Moose and trying to be
    compatible with both Moose and Mouse.

  - The Changes file had the wrong version numbers, it should have had
    1.00 instead of 0.01.

1.00  Thu Feb  9 18:00 2012
  - original version
